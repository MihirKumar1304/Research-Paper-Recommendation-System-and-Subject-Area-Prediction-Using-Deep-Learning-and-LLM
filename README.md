This machine learning project seamlessly combines a Research Papers Recommendation System and Subject Area Prediction to enhance research accessibility and categorization. By leveraging advanced sentence transformers for embedding generation and cosine similarity for precise recommendations, the system suggests highly relevant research papers tailored to user preferences. Additionally, an MLP-based deep learning model captures complex patterns to classify research papers into subject areas with remarkable accuracy, reaching 99%. The project employs **NLP techniques** for robust text classification, offering a comprehensive solution for researchers to discover and organize academic content effectively.
